## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

## Testing the API

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install form-data
```

### 2. Run the Test Script
```bash
npm run test-profile-upload
```

### 3. Manual Testing with cURL
```bash
# Test configuration
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/profile/test-config

# Upload profile picture
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -F "profilePicture=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/profile/upload-picture
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Cloudinary configuration is missing"
- **Solution**: Check your `.env` file and ensure all Cloudinary variables are set

### 2. "File too large"
- **Solution**: Reduce file size to under 10MB or increase the limit in `cloudinaryHelper.js`

### 3. "Only image files are allowed"
- **Solution**: Ensure you're uploading a valid image file with supported format

### 4. "No file uploaded"
- **Solution**: Make sure the form field name is exactly `profilePicture`

### 5. "Unexpected field name"
- **Solution**: Use `profilePicture` as the field name in your form data

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check the test configuration endpoint** first to verify Cloudinary setup
2. **Check server logs** for detailed error information
3. **Verify file format** and size before uploading
4. **Test with a small image** first to isolate issues
5. **Check network connectivity** to Cloudinary
